These temperatures are taken directly from the data loggers.
I also use the keys/IDs taken from the data logger, which gives weird results since the thermocouple trees do not seem to be evenly distributed in the compartment.

Since, I decided to use Alastair's distribution of the TC trees. The problem I don't know where that comes from.
